# Final-project-NS- Contributions
# Tumen:
Assisted with data cleaning, corrected longitude and latitude, cleaned data in code, drew graph with positions, customized the graph to look pretty, added 'degree' attribute to the nodes. Implemented HALF-BAKED infection (SIR model) and implemneted it on the map. Updated SIR model, added histogram for data distribution. Polished the histograms and made a function which removes important nodes (with help from code by Tijana). Finished the code (optimization + graphs)
# Hui:
Assisted wit data cleaning, report section: Theory, methods(50%)
# Tijana:
Add weight to the edges, write code for centrality measures + top 5 airport-nodes, which can be removed one by one, write abstract, introduction, analysis and conclusion
# Dominik:
Finding the dataset, creating the basemap, calculating centrality measures and finding top airports, preparing the slides of the presentation.
